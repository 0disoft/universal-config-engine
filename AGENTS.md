## Repository Scope

Scope: backend

This repository owns API server behavior, server-side domain rules, authentication,
authorization, persistence, migrations, observability, and backend security.

This repository does not own frontend routing, visual design, component hierarchy,
design tokens, or browser interaction policy.

Frontend-facing behavior is contracted through `api/openapi.yaml`, `api/examples/*.json`,
`docs/backend/04-http-api-policy.md`, and `docs/backend/05-error-response.md`.

## Repository Shape

Primary repository type: library
Addons: cli-tool

- library: This repository type owns public API surface, package compatibility, semantic versioning, migration guidance, distribution artifacts, and consumer-facing deprecation policy.
- cli-tool: This repository type owns command behavior, arguments, flags, config loading, exit codes, terminal output, JSON output, runtime compatibility, and shell integration contracts.


## Source of Truth

- Product scope: docs/product/02-spec.md
- Architecture decisions: docs/adr/*.md
- Validation: VALIDATION.md
- Agent routing: .agents/context-map.md
- Repository hygiene: .editorconfig, .gitattributes, .gitignore

## Hard Rules

- Do not generate or infer application source code from this scaffold.
- Do not invent technology choices. Use UNDECIDED when a decision is not known.
- Do not create fake credentials, tokens, secrets, or private values.
- Do not rely on generated, cache, or build output as source truth.

## Repository Hygiene

- .editorconfig sets line ending, encoding, and final newline policy.
- .gitattributes sets Git text normalization and binary diff policy.
- .gitignore excludes local, secret, build, and cache artifacts.
- Generated, cache, and build output must not be used as design-document evidence.
- Do not create large diffs that only change line endings.

## Before Editing

- Read this file, VALIDATION.md, CHECKLIST.md, and .agents/context-map.md.
- Read the skill and checklist named by the context map.
- Confirm source-of-truth documents before changing contracts.

## Out of Scope

- Application source scaffolding.
- Runtime infrastructure such as Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, or framework apps.
- Project-specific credentials or deployment secrets.

## Final Response Requirements

- List executed validations, passed validations, skipped validations, skip reasons, and remaining risk.
- Name any source-of-truth documents changed.
- Call out API, DB, repository hygiene, and runner changes explicitly.
